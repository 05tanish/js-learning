//! ðŸ“š Summary / Notes

/*
ðŸ‘‰ Datatypes in JavaScript are divided based on how they access and store in memory:

[A] Primitive Datatypes  (call by value)
1. Number   = up to 2^53 (normal numbers)
2. String   = " " (text inside quotes)
3. Boolean  = true / false
4. BigInt   = for big numbers
5. Null     = standalone value, represents empty (nothing)
6. Undefined= means value is not defined yet
7. Symbol   = used to find uniqueness (unique identifiers)

[B] Non-Primitive Datatypes  (call by reference)
1. Object
2. Array
3. Functions
*/

//! ðŸ”¥ JavaScript is a dynamic type language
// (You don't need to declare type, it assigns at runtime)

//! ðŸ“š Memory in JavaScript

// *! Stack Memory  => used by Primitive Datatypes (Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol, BigInt)
// *! Heap Memory   => used by Non-Primitive Datatypes (Object, Array, Function)
