# JavaScript Practice

Welcome to my JavaScript practice repository!  
This repo contains daily exercises and notes as I learn JavaScript, including:

- 📁 Object basics
- 📁 Array methods
- 📁 Functions
- 📁 DOM and events (coming soon)

## 📅 Structure

Each file is named by day or topic for easy tracking.

Example:
- `day1-objects.js` – Object syntax and usage
- `day2-arrays.js` – Arrays and built-in methods

## 📌 Goals

- Improve JS fundamentals
- Build problem-solving skills
- Track daily learning progress

Feel free to explore and give feedback!
